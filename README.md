# Batch-Scheduling
Objective: 
To calculate the timing parameters of batch processes based on different scheduling algorithms. 
 
 
Specification: 
The program mimics the execution of different processes under different scheduling algorithms. 
The simulation maintains a table that reflects the current state of the system, based on choosing 
from a menu of choices, where each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices 
are:  
1) Enter parameters 
2) Schedule processes with FIFO algorithm  
3) Schedule processes with SJF algorithm 
4) Schedule processes with SRT algorithm 
5) Quit program and free memory
